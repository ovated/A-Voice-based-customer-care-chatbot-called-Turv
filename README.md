# A-Voice-based-customer-care-chatbot-called-Turv

Developed in Python programming language with Pycharm IDE and some libraries like:

NLTK,
speech_recognition,
sounddevice,
gtts,
playsound,
wavio e.t.c.

This project allows users to input their message request, by speaking to the program,
which converts the sound to text, matches the text and find a corresponding answer and converts that to audio.

This project consists of four python programs:

turv.py: This is the main program,
sound_recognizer.py: This is for recognizing speech from the user.
text_to_audio.py: This is for converting text to audio.
chatter.py: This is a replica of the util module from the nltk.chat.util library, modified to work with this program properly.
